# PowerShell ScriptBlock Logging Bypass
In Windows 10 / PowerShell 5.0, Microsoft introduced several new security features in PowerShell. These included the AMSI, Protected Event Logging, and maybe most importantly ScriptBlock logging. The comprehensive ScriptBlock logging now available in PowerShell has presented serious problems for attackers. Now, it is possible for defenders to have access to full logs recording all of an attackerâ€™s malicious PowerShell activity. This has caused some to even suggest that the offensive community should move away from PowerShell altogether.
